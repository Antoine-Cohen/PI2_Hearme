# PI2_Hearme
## Welcome to the (H)ear-me project! <br>
This project aims to help people who are aurally impared, deaf or have trouble hearing sounds. <br>

We implemented a solution: a neckband connected to an app <br>
- the neckband vibrates when a sound is detected <br>
- The sound is then sent to the app by bluetooth and is identified with AI.<br>

To see the app: -> go to the branch **react** <br>
To see the AI part: -> got to the branch **Machine-Learning-Models** <br>
